This directory contains the EIS switching application I developed
for Prof Jeff Dahn in Summer 2017, as well as supporting information.

REQUIREMENTS:
	The program will throw an exception if the Visual Basic
	National Instruments library is not installed, though the
	front panel of the program will still load  upon clicking
	'continue'.
	
	The hardware needed for this program to work is listed in the
	attached manual. The switching units were made in the lab and
	are controlled by the Keithley multimeters.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
	Dr Jeff Dahn for giving me the opportunity to work in his lab
	Dr Robbie Sanderson for providing guidance through the project
	Dr Jim Li for helping to locate a critical flaw
	All other members of the Dahn group for being great coworkers
